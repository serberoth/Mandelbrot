Simple Mandelbrot
Written By: Serberoth
------------------------------------------------------------
This application plots a Mandelbrot set in two ways it
plots a textual version of the Mandelbrot set and prints
that out to the console and then it plots a graphical
version of the same set and outputs that to a file named
'output.png'.
The graphical plot can be controlled by the 'plot.json'
file.
